# Scenario

Welcome to Random Next Industries (RNI), where I took on the role of a 
Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. RNI specializes in designing virtual 
reality programs for businesses, pushing the boundaries of immersive technology to enhance various industries' operations.

Recently, rumors have surfaced indicating that a competitor, MoCorp, may be planning cyberattacks to disrupt RNI's business operations. As an SOC analyst, my primary responsibility is to proactively monitor RNI's systems and applications for any signs of suspicious activity or potential cyber threats.

The RNI products under my monitoring scope include:

1. Apache Web Server: This server hosts the administrative webpage, providing a gateway for managing various aspects of RNI's virtual reality programs.
2. Windows Operating System: Many of RNI's back-end operations are powered by Windows systems, making them critical components of the company's infrastructure.

To effectively monitor and defend against potential cyber threats, I leveraged Splunk, a powerful Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. Splunk will enable me to ingest, analyze, and visualize vast amounts of log data generated by VSI's systems and applications.

My networking team has provided me with historical logs to help establish baselines, identify anomalies, and develop reports, alerts, and dashboards. Armed with this data and Splunk's capabilities, my mission is to ensure the security and integrity of RNI's systems, preemptively detecting and mitigating any threats posed by MoCorp or other malicious actors.

Get ready to dive into the world of defensive security, leveraging Splunk to safeguard Random Next Industries against potential cyber threats and ensure the continued success of its innovative virtual reality programs.
