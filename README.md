# Defensive Security Monitoring - Splunk Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Defensive Security SIEM Project repository. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using Splunk. The primary goal is to showcase the process of setting up, configuring, and utilizing Splunk for defensive security purposes.

## Project Overview
The Defensive Security SIEM Project provides a practical reference for cybersecurity enthusiasts, students, and professionals interested in defensive security operations. It covers various aspects of SIEM implementation, including data ingestion, threat detection, incident response, compliance monitoring, and dashboard creation. Through this project, I aim to:

- Illustrate the importance of SIEM solutions in modern cybersecurity operations.
- Provide hands-on experience in setting up and configuring a SIEM environment using Splunk.
- Demonstrate the utilization of Splunk for threat detection, incident response, and compliance monitoring.
- Offer insights into building customized dashboards for security monitoring and analysis.

## Features
- Comprehensive SIEM Framework: Detailed instructions and examples covering the setup, configuration, and utilization of Splunk for defensive security purposes.
- Real-world Scenarios: Simulated security environments reflecting common cybersecurity challenges and threats encountered in real-world systems.
- Tool Demonstrations: Practical demonstrations showcasing the usage of Splunk for log collection, analysis, and correlation.
- Threat Detection and Incident Response: Techniques for detecting and responding to security threats using Splunk's capabilities.
- Compliance Monitoring: Guidance on leveraging Splunk for compliance monitoring and reporting to meet regulatory requirements.
- Analyzing Windows Server and Apache Logs: Included instructions and examples for analyzing logs from Windows Server and Apache web servers to enhance threat detection and incident response capabilities.

## Scenario

Welcome to Random Next Industries (RNI), where I took on the role of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. RNI specializes in designing virtual reality programs for businesses, pushing the boundaries of immersive technology to enhance various industries' operations.

Recently, rumors have surfaced indicating that a competitor, MoCorp, may be planning cyberattacks to disrupt RNI's business operations. As an SOC analyst, my primary responsibility is to proactively monitor RNI's systems and applications for any signs of suspicious activity or potential cyber threats.

The RNI products under my monitoring scope include:

1. Apache Web Server: This server hosts the administrative webpage, providing a gateway for managing various aspects of RNI's virtual reality programs.
2. Windows Operating System: Many of RNI's back-end operations are powered by Windows systems, making them critical components of the company's infrastructure.

To effectively monitor and defend against potential cyber threats, I leveraged Splunk, a powerful Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. Splunk will enable me to ingest, analyze, and visualize vast amounts of log data generated by VSI's systems and applications.

My networking team has provided me with historical logs to help establish baselines, identify anomalies, and develop reports, alerts, and dashboards. Armed with this data and Splunk's capabilities, my mission is to ensure the security and integrity of RNI's systems, preemptively detecting and mitigating any threats posed by MoCorp or other malicious actors.

Get ready to dive into the world of defensive security, leveraging Splunk to safeguard Random Next Industries against potential cyber threats and ensure the continued success of its innovative virtual reality programs.
